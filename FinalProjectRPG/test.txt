Humanity prospered for centuries as technology advanced and resources were plentiful.
It was then when humanity least expected it where the demon king and his armies struck.
Starting from the most populous cites, the ruthless demons swept through the region covering the azure sky in eternal darkness.
Without the power to stop them, the humans evacuate in panic while the demons march behind in pursuit.
As a last defense, the kingdom's holy wizards fight to prevent the extinct of humanity.
Suddenly a magical meteor fell from the sky and split in to chunks that rained across the land.
One piece was headed ...
For your house.
...
(BOOOOOOMMM!!!!!!!!!!)
