 -You see a badly injured person fending off slimes.
???-*mutters something barely audible*
 -A violent flash of light extends from the person and strike one of the slimes dealing a fatal blow.
 -The person looks visibly fatigued.
Scarlet-(I need to help him!)
???-(Why is there still a civilian here!)
???-Didn't you hear the evacuation signal! You need to leave now. I can handle this myself.
Scarlet-Do you have a death wish?! You can possibly fight in that state!
Scarlet-I'll help you take them on.
