Scarlet-Are you ok?
???-Never mind me, how are you so strong? You rival even the best mages!
Scarlet-I've trained with the sword before but I feel great today!
???-That doesn't explain the massive magical aura that surrounds you.
???-I came here searching for a strong magical signature that was eminating from here a couple hours ago.
???-Now that aura seems to be coming from you.
Scarlet-(Maybe this has something to do with the strange dream I had earlier ...)
Scarlet-My memory is fuzzy but I faintly remember touching a strange rock...
???-(Rock! Could the legends be true? If that's the case...)
???-You could be the key stopping the demons!
Scarlet-What?!
???-The legends say that once a mellenia, a comet will pass in humanity's darkess hour and give the power of hope!
Scarlet-What are you suggesting?
???-I am saying that you might be the hero that saves us all!
Scarlet-Woah, I don't even know you and what is a girl with a sword from a town in the middle of nowhere suppose to fair against the demon king?!
Aqus-Don't worry I'll help you. My name is Aqus and I'm the one of the strongest mages in thee realm.
Scarlet-Wow, one of the strongest mages can't even fight a couple slimes *chuckles*
Aqus-Hey I lost my staff and my robes so I was forced to fight with a practise wand!
Aqus-In any case we have to get stronger. Our goal is to find more of the "rocks", I remeber another magical signature close by.
Scarlet-(I'm still skeptical but I'll trust this guy for now.)
